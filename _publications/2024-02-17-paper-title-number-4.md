excerpt: 'The present study proposes an active structural control method utilizing a plate hinged at the bottom of a spar-type floating substructure as an external control device. The controller is developed under an optimal declutching control framework, in which the damping coefficient of the PTO system is set as a binary function. It is found that current optimal declutching control strategy can effectively minimize the pitch motion of the spar-type substructure and maximize the PTOâ€™s power simultaneously.'
