I am a postdoctoral Research Associate with the Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering at [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). I obtained my PhD in Naval Architecture, Marine, and Ocean Engineering in 2024 from [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/), UK, my MSc in Mechanics in 2018 from [Harbin Engineering University](https://english.hrbeu.edu.cn/), China, and my BSc in Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering in 2016 from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), China.

I am currently working in [Prof Guang Li](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/guang-li)'s team, focusing on control-oriented modelling and HIL design of an onshore wave energy converter. My last job is as a Research Associate in Hydrodynamics & Ocean Renewable Laboratory ([HOREL](https://www.horelstrath.com/)) with [Dr Zhiming Yuan](https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/persons/zhiming-yuan) and [Dr David Dai](https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/persons/david-dai) on renewable energy and offshore hydrodynamics.

My research interests include:
------
•	Multibody hydrodynamics: The motion or power optimisation of connected floating bodies.

•	Floating wind turbine: The wave-induced motion of large floating wind turbines.

•	Optimal control: Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle (PMP) & Linear-quadratic regulator (LQR).

•	Discrete control: On-off control including latching and declutching control.

•	Model predictive control: Neural network for the prediction of real-time control.

Personal skills:
------
1. Coding: MATLAB.

2. Hydrodynamic analysis software: SESAM, STAR-CCM+, FLUENT.

3. CAD Modelling software: Rhino, SolidWorks, UG NX.
