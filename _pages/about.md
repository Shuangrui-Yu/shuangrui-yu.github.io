I am a postdoctoral Research Associate with the Department of Naval Architecture, Marine, and Ocean Engineering at University of Strathclyde. I obtained my PhD in NOAME in 2024 from [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/), UK, my MSc in Mechanics in 2018 from [Harbin Engineering University](https://www.hrbeu.edu.cn/), China, and my BSc in Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering in 2016 from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), China.

I am currently working in Hydrodynamics & Ocean Renewable Laboratory ([HOREL](https://www.horelstrath.com/)) with [Dr Zhi-Ming Yuan](https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/persons/zhiming-yuan) and [Dr Sai-Shuai Dai](https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/persons/david-dai) on renewable energy and offshore hydrodynamics.

My research interests include:
======
Multibody hydrodynamics: The motion or power optimisation of connected floating bodies.
Floating wind turbine: The wave-induced motion of large floating wind turbines.
Optimal control: Pontryaginâ€™s Maximum Principle (PMP) & Linear-quadratic regulator (LQR).
Discrete control: On-off control including latching and declutching control.
Model predictive control: Neural network for the prediction of real-time control.

Funding and Awards:
------
1. 2022.06: Best presenter of OE Session in Ocean Energy and Marine Transport (OEMT) Research Conference 2022.
2. 2019.10~2022.10: John Anderson Research Award (JARA) Studentship of University of Strathclyde
3. 2019.10~2022.10: China Scholarship Council (CSC) Scholarship

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
